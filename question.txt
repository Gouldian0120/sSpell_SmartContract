- Calculate the amount $sSpell (staked spell) and provide the equivalent in $Spell

This means that new contract will calculate the amount $sSell in the user's wallet and provide the equivalent in $Spell to user's wallet, right?

Then This contract already has enough $Spell tokens to provide the $Spell to holder of $sSell, who gave these contract?

- Calculate any spell gains from the staking day. If it helps this is the contract that buys $Spell (with the earnings generated by the protocol) and distributes to the holders of $sSpell: 

from where does this new contract buy $Spell and distributes to the holders?

There must be to develop new protocol or algorithm to generate earnings from staking day or can we use normal earnings of $sSpell contract?

Can you explain more details about this second function?


- Question

I know that users can stakes $Spell token into the $sSpell contract and gains rewards of $Spell after his locking period.
Then, What is the purpose of this new contract? The purpose is to give extra rewards to holders of $sSpell or others?

I hope to discuss details of this project, you can contact me $SkypeId live:.cid.ca629d76981d1762, telegram : @webdev0305
