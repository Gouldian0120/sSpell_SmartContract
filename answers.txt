Q


- Calculate the amount $sSpell (staked spell) and provide the equivalent in $Spell

This means that new contract will calculate the amount $sSell in the user's wallet and provide the equivalent in $Spell to user's wallet, right?

R

- This simply means that the sc reads the amount of sspell in the wallet and "show" the equivalent in sspell. Without any transaction. It simply has to calculate the ration of sspel/spell at that moment.

- The ratio changes each time the protocol buys spells with the revenues of protocol itself. I don't know where the ratio is in their sc, I usually go to this link: https://abracadabra.money/spell-stake

Q

Then This contract already has enough $Spell tokens to provide the $Spell to holder of $sSell, who gave these contract?

R

Q

- Calculate any spell gains from the staking day. If it helps this is the contract that buys $Spell (with the earnings generated by the protocol) and distributes to the holders of $sSpell: 

from where does this new contract buy $Spell and distributes to the holders?

R

- this is the last trascation that brought spell with protocol revenues: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x45bb9544dd4ef64c85081f784990e2159070b7f466c9326ecce32e9a11349142

does it help?

Q

There must be to develop new protocol or algorithm to generate earnings from staking day or can we use normal earnings of $sSpell contract?

R

The APY changes and is not fixed, so I think we just have to do this calculation:
- go back to the "staking transaction" of the user's wallet and know how many spells have been staked
- calculate the difference in spell equivalent to the sspell in his possession
- calculate the average apy in the period from the staking date to now.

Q


- Question

I know that users can stakes $Spell token into the $sSpell contract and gains rewards of $Spell after his locking period.
Then, What is the purpose of this new contract? The purpose is to give extra rewards to holders of $sSpell or others?

R

There is no distribution purpose. There is simply no clear way for us in the community, so I would like to offer this tool. No transactions must be involved, the user's wallet is just the starting point to help him understand how many spells he has earned and the APY since the staking day.
